# (Stalled and abandoned) MTK telephony stack for CM12.1

This is a reiteration of my comment on commit b59f18c; please **do not**
depend on this piece of code in any way as it is incomplete and broken,
mainly because the way MTK does things deviate from AOSP too much that
it becomes unfeasible to reconcile the two. Also I have to allocate more of
my time to academics, so less time for porting; as a result I have to abandon
my CDMA SVLTE and VoLTE efforts altogether.

My plan is to suspend all MTK porting until first MTK Marshmallow code drop
happens (likely from Zopo). Let's see if MTK again chooses to alienate its
already small ROM-er base :-/
